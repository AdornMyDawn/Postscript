Letterboxd for life; A minimalist social platform that will blend the curation of pinterest, cataloging of letterboxd, and the expressive freedom of MySpace. It's design for those who want to share their lives, moments or keep little secrets to themselves without pressure, algorithms or comparison.

A space for Journaling, sharing art, thoughts, quotes, and inspiration
curating your life into "Volumes" and keeping a circle with those you want instead of a follower count
